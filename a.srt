00:00:07,982 --> 00:00:09,861
<i>Previously, on</i> Marvel's Runaways...

2
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:12,617
- Jesus, Alex!
- Linh dep trai.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,080
Linh dep trai.
Linh dep trai.

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:18,921
Linh dep traier
taken this long before.

5
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,217
Linh dep trai all?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,054
We're gonna need another sacrifice.

7
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:26,352
- The solution is right...
- We are in trouble here, Victor.

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:27,897
I know I screwed up.

9
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,581
First the girl,
and now this false alarm?

10
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:31,404
What is going on with you?

11
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:33,324
Maybe the bracelet
is some kind of inhibitor?

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,457
Linh dep trai my mom
never wanted me to take it off.

13
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:40,673
Get away from her!

14
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,013
Holy shit, it does what I say.

15
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:46,142
Give me that. What is this thing called?

16
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:47,854
Fistigons.

17
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:49,774
I've made arrangements
for you at the Crater.

18
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:52,822
- What?
- I sense that you're ready to go Ultra.

19
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:54,491
So my parents are serial killers,

20
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:56,162
and Karolina's mother
handpicks the victims.

21
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:57,372
Alex cracked the files.

22
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:58,736
They weren't about any ceremony.

23
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,836
They were about...

24
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,380
<i>Destiny isn't the only runaway</i>

25
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:03,761
<i>to go missing from your church.</i>

26
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:07,225
Alex! Alex! Someone took Alex!

27
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,834
Yo, G! That's my boy.

28
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:22,339
You off to see that
fine-ass lawyer of yours?

29
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:23,842
Whoo!

30
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:26,347
Guess she can't get enough
of that Wilder flavor.

31
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,606
Man! You get all the breaks, bro.

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,860
You the one who's halfway out the door.

33
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:35,031
I need every break I can get in here.

34
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,419
Have fun!

35
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,236
Wrong room.

36
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,702
You're Geoffrey Wilder, right?

37
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:03,589
Please. I'm sure you'll be
interested in what I have to say.

38
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,936
Trying to run some shit
without my lawyer?

39
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,483
'Cause I ain't going
for no plea bargain.

40
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,199
Who okayed this? This is a
violation of my client's rights.

41
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:19,203
Uh-oh, did it now.

42
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,463
Perfect timing, like always.

43
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:26,635
Catherine Henderson,
Mr. Wilder's attorney.

44
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:28,095
The DA sent you?

45
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,099
No, I'm here of my own accord.

46
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,312
I have a business proposal for you.

47
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:35,026
I'm happy to continue with your attorney
present, if that works for you.

48
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:39,076
She's in on every deal I make.
So, yeah, she stays.

49
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:42,959
Very well, then.

50
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:48,887
I believe your uncle left you
this property when he passed.

51
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:51,100
- Is that correct?
- It's an old strip mall.

52
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,396
How you know about that?

53
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,983
I'd like to buy it from you.

54
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,153
My opening offer is $5 million.

55
00:02:57,237 --> 00:03:00,410
Five million dollars for a junk
property in South Central?

56
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:02,414
What's the fine print?

57
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:05,671
I understand it's probably more
than it's worth, but...

58
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,800
I'd like to make this agreement quickly.

59
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:11,307
No white man's gonna drop
that much cake on some dump

60
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,227
if there wasn't more to it.

61
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:16,526
What, the X mark the spot to some
buried treasure or something?

62
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,362
You're a perceptive fellow, Mr. Wilder.

63
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:21,620
Truth is, you have
a hidden gem on your hands.

64
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,207
I'd like to see it
reach its full potential.

65
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,128
You're in real estate, then.

66
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:29,051
Didn't realize Compton was on
the next gentrification train.

67
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:31,598
I can't speak to future market value,

68
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:34,854
but I assure you I have nothing but the
best intentions for this property.

69
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:37,818
Perhaps you'd like some time

70
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:39,446
to get the clarity you need.

71
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:44,999
I'll see myself out. Thank you.

72
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,381
Uh, no, I don't need
any more time in here.

73
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:50,218
I got all the clarity I need.

74
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:53,725
If someone like you wants to know
something in my neighborhood,

75
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,521
then you gonna need a partner.

76
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:57,273
Even with your fine legal counsel,

77
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,987
you may be incarcerated for some time.

78
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:03,452
Doesn't make for a very
convenient partnership.

79
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,498
I can handle my business
from the inside.

80
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:07,085
Not my business.

81
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,596
I'm sorry, it's
a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

82
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,433
You can keep the map.

83
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,938
What if I were to say that in
a month he'd be a free man?

84
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,966
That could be a different story.

85
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,304
<i>- It's breakfast time for the cheetah.</i>
- Ooh.

86
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,389
Ooh, got him.

87
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:37,312
- Hey, hey.
- Yo.

88
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:40,109
What's up, G? You don't look like a dude

89
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:43,491
who just got a hand job
from his Tenderoni lawyer.

90
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,078
What, she break up with you?

91
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,627
Nah, nah, nothing like that.

92
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,467
Your Nana B, she still got that,
um, that breathing thing?

93
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,346
With the oxygen tanks and all that?

94
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:57,102
Yeah. Somebody gotta go
check on it every day.

95
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:58,730
Why you ask?

96
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:02,947
And Tamar, she got two
little ones now, right?

97
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:05,409
What's going on, G?

98
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:09,292
What if I told you
I'd look out for them,

99
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,171
take care of them for life?

100
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:14,846
I'd say thank you, but why?

101
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,991
Because I need something from you.

102
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,203
To call it a favor don't do it justice.

103
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,665
Okay.

104
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:31,086
I need you to tell them

105
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,465
that you shot Osiris, not me.

106
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:40,146
I got a deal on the table
that'll change all our lives.

107
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,943
The thing is, I gotta get out
of here to make it work.

108
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:49,039
G, man, you asking me
to do a dime at least, bro.

109
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,878
I know what I'm asking.

110
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:54,132
We've always been there
for each other, right?

111
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:55,218
Since we was kids.

112
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,055
Yeah, man, but...

113
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,267
I'm just an accessory to some shit,

114
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,271
and like you said,
I got my foot out the door...

115
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:04,946
Yeah, but you go right back where
you were, straight hustle.

116
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,534
But what I'm saying, we move up.

117
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,956
A different life, man,

118
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,630
for Nana B, for Tamar and those babies.

119
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:15,383
For you.

120
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:28,409
All right, big homie, I got you.

121
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,248
Just don't forget me, G.

122
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,375
Never.

123
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:16,129
Where are we going?

124
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:17,841
Alex, my man...

125
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,391
you're about to find out
who your father really is.

126
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:26,233
Keep going. We almost there.

<i>Hey. Currently training on Dagobah.
Leave a message.</i>

129
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,480
Alex, I-I don't know if you'll
even get this, but just...

130
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:54,660
If you do, just call me, okay? I...

131
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,793
- I don't even know what to say.
- What if it was my church?

132
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:01,298
What if they figured out that we
got those files on all those kids?

133
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,928
No, no, please don't tell me that
everything is gonna be okay.

134
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:07,226
My mom is a murderer. All of
our parents are murderers.

135
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:10,149
Hey.

136
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,018
The only way to figure this
out is to stick together.

137
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,189
But right now, we just
need to get Alex back.

138
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:32,736
Okay?

139
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,463
You ready to go?

140
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:45,512
Where are we going?
We have no clue where Alex is.

141
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,104
Did you steal that from your mom?

142
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:51,187
You're in trouble.

143
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:53,151
You think it can help us?

144
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,571
I'm counting on it.

145
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:01,501
Show us the way to Alex.

146
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:08,265
So much for the magical
Wiccan proclamations.

147
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:16,156
What is that thing?

148
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,034
I don't know, but I think I'm in love.

149
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,623
The lights are pretty,
but how is this helping?

150
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,794
I think it's the heat signature
of the car that took Alex.

151
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:24,840
Yeah, the staff is trying
to lead us to him.

152
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,969
- I'll drive.
- Wait! Hold on a second.

153
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:29,725
I am all for the idea of rescuing Alex,

154
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:31,352
but we have no clue
what we're going up against.

155
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,524
- It could be my church.
- Or the cops.

156
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:36,614
Alex and I found out our parents
were paying off the police.

157
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:38,826
Okay, so, just so I understand,

158
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,291
we're either gonna be facing off
against Gibborim enforcer types,

159
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,337
or a corrupt branch of the LAPD...

160
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,740
Could just be generic kidnappers.

161
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,384
...with no weapons and no plans.

162
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:49,013
We have the staff and each other.

163
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,600
Plus, like I keep telling you guys,

164
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,019
I'm really, really strong!

165
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,525
Molly, not now! What about Chase?

166
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:57,238
I sent him, like, a million texts,
but he hasn't answered any of them.

167
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:59,075
Shouldn't he be here?

168
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,398
We'll keep trying him on
the way, but we can't lose Alex.

169
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,972
Do you think the Pentagon will
want to buy the design from me?

170
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,393
If you can get the myoelectric
sensors operating

171
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,815
at a quick enough response
rate, I don't see why not.

172
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,401
I figure with
the right LAWS, these things

173
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,614
will be able to shoot
a drone out of the sky.

174
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:21,411
- LAWS?
- You know, laser-aided weapon systems.

175
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:22,873
Yes, I'm aware.

176
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,458
How is it that you know all this,

177
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,298
but you've never gotten
above a B-minus in calculus?

178
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:30,053
Calc's boring. I like
practical applications.

179
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,228
Oh, I got it.

180
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:42,286
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

181
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:50,260
Uh, I-I know I've been hard on you.

182
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:56,439
I'm just trying to get you
to be your best.

183
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,986
I want you to do greater things
with your life than I have.

184
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,537
You've, like,
actually changed the world.

185
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,040
I'll never top that.

186
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:06,250
Don't be so sure.

187
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:10,384
You know, there was a time

188
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:14,977
before the money and obligations...

189
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,693
when it was just me, my
imagination, and my hands.

190
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:21,280
It's when the ideas were the purest.

191
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:23,493
Working with you reminds me of that.

192
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:26,457
I like working with you, too, Dad.

193
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,671
You know, there was
an invention in those days

194
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,048
I could never quite get right.

195
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,219
It was something very close to my heart.

196
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:35,392
Maybe we could dig it out,

197
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:38,314
see if we can perfect
the damn thing, together.

198
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,485
Yeah. That'd be cool.

199
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:43,657
Yeah.

200
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,505
- Try this.
- Yeah.

201
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,291
I take it your daddy never showed
you his old stomping grounds.

202
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:11,214
Why leave your part of the world, right?

203
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:16,600
Got all them palm trees,
white girls, and sushi.

204
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:21,192
Give me your phone.

205
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:22,612
You heard me.

206
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:34,886
Let's go.

207
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:46,492
This is my Nana B's place.

208
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,123
Me and your pop
spent a lot of time here.

209
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:51,294
G's mom worked three jobs.

210
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,423
Anytime he needed a meal,

211
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:55,553
place to go,

212
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:57,264
my Nana B hooked him up.

213
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,433
You two were close?

214
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:01,648
Who, me and G? Shit.

215
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:02,901
Tight as hell.

216
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:05,363
He never say nothing?

217
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,827
Guess I can't say I'm surprised.

218
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,789
You know, I'm betting he never told you

219
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:12,629
that I'm the reason
he got out of lockup so fast.

220
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:14,423
Yeah.

221
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:17,555
Your pops promised
if I confessed to his crime,

222
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,228
me and my family would be set for life.

223
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:24,109
He swore he'd never forget me.

224
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,579
You think he kept his word?

225
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,543
Never gave you anything, did he?

226
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:35,967
No money, nothing.

227
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,597
Oh, G let me have his old turf.

228
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,185
Acted like it was some grand gesture.

229
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:45,068
But times changed since
your daddy was in the game.

230
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,532
Ain't as lucrative
as it was when he came up.

231
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:52,082
Else I just ain't got his flair
for community relations.

232
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,507
But meanwhile, my Nana B,

233
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:59,221
the lady who slapped
Band-Aids on his knees

234
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:01,727
and baked him his birthday cakes,

235
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,983
barely got cash to pay
for her heart pills.

236
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,446
Son of a bitch even had
the balls to threaten her

237
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,784
just 'cause I asked him
to give me what I was owed.

238
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,122
Damn.

239
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:15,462
Looks like you already know what
type of catch your old man is.

240
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:17,967
All I know is that I'm nothing like him.

241
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:22,100
I'm sorry for what he's done.

242
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:28,614
Who is calling?

243
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,665
Oh! It's your girl.

244
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,711
Six missed calls.

245
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:38,341
But you can't holla back
just yet, young homie.

246
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,178
Be easy.

247
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,206
<i>Big G! What's up?</i>

248
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,751
Say something to your pops.

249
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:57,212
Hi, Dad.

250
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:59,466
Alex, you all right?

251
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,053
I'm okay.

252
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,600
That situation could change
if you and me can't come

253
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,938
to a hospitable conclusion
to this whole thing.

254
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:08,735
- I got your 50k.
- 50k?

255
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:12,869
Did this player just say 50k?

256
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:15,206
Oh, no, no, G.

257
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,587
50k was the family discount.

258
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,674
<i>We ain't family no more.</i>

259
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,887
<i>New price is a straight million.</i>

260
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,515
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

261
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,228
One million dollars,
and I don't take checks.

262
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:27,982
Meet me in an hour at the park.

263
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:29,484
<i>You know the one.</i>

264
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:34,494
Hey. Dinner's almost here.

265
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:36,373
Who were you on the phone with?

266
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,046
Just a... wrong number.

267
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:42,762
I gotta step out.

268
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:44,348
I gotta take care of something.

269
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,823
Flores, I need three guys
in an unmarked car, now.

270
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,537
We need to slow down, okay?

271
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,427
- I don't want to lose Alex!
- We'll lose him if we crash!

272
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,197
...swerving, it's about crashing.

273
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,564
It's not about how sick I feel,

274
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,647
but it's also a little bit
about how sick I feel.

275
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,987
This kind of reminds me
of Magic Mountain or Six Flags.

276
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,203
Karolina, are you checking
your blind spots?

277
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,625
We're almost there. Refill?

278
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,213
Oh, thanks.

279
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,031
Hey, what's going on?

280
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:35,754
I'm with everyone.
We need your assistance

281
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:38,998
to save Alex from
some unidentified abductors.

282
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:40,035
What?

283
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:42,255
<i>There's a lot of insanity to fill you
on, but we'll get to that later, okay?</i>

284
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,927
Right now just get in your car and I'm
gonna send you our GPS address, okay?

285
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:46,681
<i>Cool. See you then. Bye!</i>

286
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,652
Relax, bro. Help is on the way.

287
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,622
That is, if you don't kill us first.

288
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,542
- Karolina, you're doing great.
- Thank you.

289
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:01,836
This is kind of fun.

290
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,180
How'd you guys find me, anyway?

291
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:09,351
We called your dad's phone, fool.

292
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:11,397
No, his security's tight.
He'd know if his cell

293
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,234
showed any signs of being compromised.

294
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:17,075
All I did was put a modified
EEPROM into his phone signal

295
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:18,704
and snag the serial number.

296
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:21,668
Five minutes later, his data was mine.

297
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:25,133
What, you think the only people
good with tech lives in Brentwood?

298
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:26,343
I didn't say that.

299
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,013
You ain't had to say it.

300
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:35,319
That your dad?

301
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:38,702
What? Nah, man.

302
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,875
Why do you work for him?

303
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,339
I bet the trees in your 'hood
grows jobs and scholarships.

304
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:48,137
Where I'm from, we don't
got too many trees, homie.

305
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,018
Hey, who said y'all could get out?

306
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:54,149
What's this? Y'all dating now?

307
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,623
Go, go!

308
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:26,088
Alex, give me that.

309
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,279
- Please help me, man.
- Dad.

310
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,491
Give me a second, Alex, I need to...

311
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:43,455
- Dad, I mean it.
- What is it, Al...

312
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,546
Too late. Get in the car.

313
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:52,181
That-that-that guy
has a gun to Alex's head.

314
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:55,313
- If you hurt him...
- You gonna do what?

315
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,651
Make me pay? Shit, man, I already paid.

316
00:19:57,735 --> 00:20:00,741
You the one that owe the dues, homie.

317
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,329
The odds of surviving a confrontation
seem increasingly slim.

318
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,376
- I'm not abandoning Alex.
- But we have no chance!

319
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,007
I say we do. Karolina, go!

320
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:14,769
You shot Andre, huh?

321
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:16,564
You think you a big man now?

322
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,442
Huh? Like your pops?

323
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:19,862
I didn't want to shoot him.

324
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,033
You better not say anything.
You better shut up!

325
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:25,164
Hey, hey, stop at this
stoplight, yo, slow down!

326
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,001
We don't need no more heat on us.

327
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:36,311
- Wait, stop! No, Nico!
- Get off of me!

328
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:39,925
- What is she doing?
- Stopping him?

329
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,289
Engine off.

330
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:47,918
...Geoffrey Wilder's son.
You can get away...

331
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,170
Deactivate!

332
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,970
Come back!

333
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:55,517
- Molly!
- Let me.

334
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,000
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

335
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,245
Hey, go, homie! What are you doing?

336
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:02,990
It ain't going nowhere!

337
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,204
Molly...

338
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:09,002
Get out the car. Get out the car!

339
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,337
Get out.

340
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,966
Hey!

341
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:14,930
- What in the hell?
- No!

342
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,355
Alex, run!

343
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:24,617
You have superpowers, too?

344
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,708
She's beautiful and she glows. Great.

345
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:29,919
Yo, yo, man!

346
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,381
I can't hold this much longer.

347
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,469
That was cute.

348
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:37,266
Y'all little kids best stand down.

349
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,778
Got the whole gang together, huh?

350
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:49,959
What is happening right now?

351
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,255
I think we're kicking ass.

352
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:56,012
Chase!

353
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,104
Nah, nah! This ain't how
it's about to go down.

354
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:03,820
Protect us!

355
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:40,852
You think you can stop
him with another shot?

356
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:42,063
I doubt it.

357
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:43,273
Maybe Molly can.

358
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,912
How about we just call it a night.

359
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,707
Shield off.

360
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,295
I'll catch up with you guys later.

361
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:56,258
Wait! Alex, wait!

362
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:00,934
Come on, come on.

363
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:04,898
Come on.

364
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:09,031
There you go.

365
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:11,829
Dad!

366
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,045
Hey, Alex!

367
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,466
You okay? What happened?
Wh-where's Darius?

368
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:21,308
- Oh, he took off.
- Alex, please, man.

369
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,521
I'm sorry, I was just doing my job.

370
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:27,320
Jesus, Dad, shouldn't he be
in an ambulance or something?

371
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:30,660
I know a place where he can
get patched up, off the grid.

372
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,666
I'm coming with you.

373
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,632
Hey, I'm sorry, you can't.

374
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:41,766
Get on that bus, get somewhere
safe, and call a car.

375
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:43,936
He's gonna be all right.

376
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,066
You're lying!

377
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:49,990
And it turns out you've
always been a liar.

378
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:52,996
Darius told me about everything,
about what you did to him.

379
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,250
You don't know the first
thing about me and Darius.

380
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,338
I'm not giving you a choice, son.

381
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,384
Get out of here. Now.

382
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,603
Now!

383
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,655
<i>Where have you been?</i>

384
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,324
Have you talked to Alex?
He never came home.

385
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:34,495
<i>Alex is fine.</i>

386
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,376
Cat, I got a live one, but I
don't think he'll last for long.

387
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,921
Get PRIDE together.

388
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,925
We need to do the sacrifice now.

389
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:46,060
You're still here.

390
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:48,858
Of course.

391
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,868
I just wanted to be by you.

392
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:59,337
And the sacrifice?

393
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,216
We're trying.

394
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,846
But it, um...

395
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,810
it isn't going well.

396
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:09,398
But we'll find someone.
We'll find a way.

397
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:11,194
I'm sure of it.

398
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:15,202
I hope you know

399
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:19,063
how much I've loved you.

400
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:32,945
- Molly, you were such a badass.
- So were you.

401
00:25:33,106 --> 00:25:35,640
- I still can't get over those lights!
- And your staff!

402
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,789
Alex! Whoa, you're okay.

403
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,125
Guys, we have a problem.

404
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,212
What are you talking about?
We got you back.

405
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,091
Yes, and now we have
to save someone else.

406
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,597
His name's Andre, he was with
the men who kidnapped me.

407
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,000
- So why would we help him?
- He was just following orders.

408
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,605
Isn't that what the Nazis said?

409
00:25:49,688 --> 00:25:51,190
He's the same age as us,
and I think our parents

410
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:53,154
are about to do to him
what they did to Destiny.

411
00:25:53,194 --> 00:25:55,365
- Okay? We have to stop them.
- Are you nuts?

412
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:56,785
We almost got shot back there,

413
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:58,204
and now you want us to risk our lives

414
00:25:58,288 --> 00:25:59,498
for some guy that we don't even know?

415
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,169
Do we even have a plan?

416
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:02,589
The plan is making sure
no more kids die.

417
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:04,760
Alex, we need to take a beat here, okay?

418
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:07,557
Many of us have just exhibited
superhuman abilities

419
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:11,439
after learning that there may be
a <i>Chinatown-</i> level conspiracy

420
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:12,567
run by our parents.

421
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,322
My head is exploding.

422
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:17,535
Molly, how can you take a nap right now?

423
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,667
You try lifting an SUV
with your bare hands.

424
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,252
It's exhausting!

425
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,925
At least you guys finally
got to see what I can do.

426
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:27,012
I've been trying
to tell you for forever.

427
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,016
Yes, Moll, we finally
believe you, but...

428
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,104
Oh, and speaking of superpowers?

429
00:26:31,187 --> 00:26:33,149
Gert has a dinosaur
that she can order around.

430
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:38,744
Are you serious? What?

431
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:40,163
It's insane.

432
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:42,126
And kind of awesome.

433
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,840
You never said anything
about Gert having a dinosaur.

434
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:47,469
I kept quiet about your lights.

435
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:50,183
Okay, yeah, I probably
should've told you guys,

436
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:52,772
but I was just worried
you'd think I was a freak.

437
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:56,320
I think we're all scoring pretty
high on the freak-o-meter tonight.

438
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:59,703
My family heirloom is
a magic staff-slash-wand.

439
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:04,671
No matter what we are, Alex is right.

440
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:08,052
We can't let our parents keep
getting away with this stuff.

441
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:10,850
- We weren't able to save Destiny.
- Maybe we can save Andre.

442
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,564
I mean, we have to at least try.

443
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,674
Here, let me help.

444
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:57,610
Tina, where's the staff?

445
00:27:57,694 --> 00:28:01,367
There was no time.
We'll be fine, just this once.

446
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:09,216
Catherine, you know how
grateful I am to have someone.

447
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,928
You mentioned he'd been shot.

448
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:14,226
I was just wondering what happened.

449
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,984
I'm sorry. This isn't one of your
grass-fed, free-range sacrifices,

450
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:23,077
but whatever Geoffrey did,
just be glad he did it.

451
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:30,091
Coasters don't work anymore.

452
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:37,437
I got it.

453
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:58,774
Gotta keep him alive, right?

454
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:02,907
Here. Drink this.

455
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,497
Is it medicine?

456
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,126
Sure.

457
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:36,558
I don't get it. Where are they?

458
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,687
Maybe we just beat them here.

459
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:40,315
My dad got a huge head start.

460
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:42,987
Then maybe our parents
took Andre somewhere else.

461
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,033
Which means he's probably dead.

462
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,039
Goddamn it!

463
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:06,658
I shot him.

464
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:10,166
- What?
- I shot Andre.

465
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,715
He was gonna hurt my dad,
so I used that gun I took.

466
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:19,059
- I killed him, Nico.
- No, you didn't.

467
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:21,438
If I hadn't shot him, my dad
wouldn't have taken him to be

468
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:22,775
his next victim or whatever.

469
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:24,737
- You don't know that.
- I pretty much do.

470
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:28,035
I killed someone to protect my dad.

471
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,916
The worst part is, I don't even
know if he's worth protecting.

472
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:34,672
Hey.

473
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:43,065
None of our parents
are who we thought...

474
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:46,740
but they're still our parents.

475
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:50,664
I'm just...

476
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,635
I'm glad we got you back.

477
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,354
I was so worried about you.

478
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,227
Guys?

479
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:26,861
Chase found a hidden camera
in the library.

480
00:31:26,945 --> 00:31:27,989
We need you down there.

481
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:47,068
Fifteen kids have died
in this room. That is so...

482
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:49,448
Messed up?

483
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,454
What if the ghosts of all
these kids are still in here,

484
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:56,086
watching us right now?

485
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,886
Okay, Molls, no more <i>Goosebumps</i> for you.

486
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:03,727
- Anything?
- Uh, no. Thankfully it's not on.

487
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,566
Probably only use it when they're
in here doing their thing.

488
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,112
Looks like the footage is being

489
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:11,241
offloaded onto a server somewhere,

490
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:13,705
but I can use it as an access point

491
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:15,584
to see what the camera's connected to

492
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,506
and translate the IP address
into a physical one.

493
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:24,226
No frickin' way.

494
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,480
Please no more bad news.

495
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:30,697
Video is being funneled
to your parents' company.

496
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,077
They're storing it at Wizard Computers?

497
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,208
The most hacker-resistant
network on the planet? Yeah.

498
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,672
Well, we have to find a way to get it.

499
00:32:38,755 --> 00:32:41,218
It's actual evidence of what
our parents have been doing.

500
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:43,013
Maybe there's an explanation.

501
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:46,103
I mean, they have to be doing all
of this for a reason, right?

502
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:47,898
What if they have a good one?

503
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,361
- Good reason to kill kids.
- Chase, come on.

504
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:54,244
I know it doesn't make any sense, but...

505
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:57,083
I don't know, I was with my dad
before, and it just made me wonder.

506
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,672
What if we're missing something here?

507
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,135
I mean, Chase, can you honestly think

508
00:33:02,218 --> 00:33:04,515
of a single reason
to justify their actions?

509
00:34:52,397 --> 00:34:53,566
It worked.

510
00:34:56,697 --> 00:34:58,075
You can all leave now.

511
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:38,363
Glad you're home safe.

512
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,712
- I'm sorry, I had to...
- Where's Andre?

513
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:51,766
You don't need to worry
about Andre anymore.

514
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,851
He's fine.

515
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,744
For as long as I can remember...

516
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,917
whenever I was with you, I felt
like the luckiest kid in the world.

517
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,923
You weren't just my father,
you were my best friend.

518
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:11,096
But the more I learn about you...

519
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:16,273
the more I realize that you're
just not a good person.

520
00:36:16,356 --> 00:36:17,860
Just get out. I want to be alone.

521
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:23,161
This is my house.

522
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:25,876
Your room is just out on loan,
so if I want to be in here...

523
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:32,013
Oh, whoa, hey. Hey, Alex. Come on, man.
You know I wouldn't...

524
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:34,392
Well, you hurt Darius,
and he was your best friend!

525
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:35,729
How do I know you wouldn't hurt me, too?

526
00:36:35,812 --> 00:36:36,898
Alex...

527
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:38,860
You know what, you stay here.

528
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:40,655
I'll sleep in the guest house.

529
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:46,959
How much did you hear?

530
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:48,378
Enough.

531
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:49,715
So, go on.

532
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:50,798
Say it.

533
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:53,890
I'm an asshole.

534
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:55,434
I'm a bad father.

535
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:57,063
I should've never let Darius...

536
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:00,946
Darius is just the name
of our latest problem...

537
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,494
one that we both had a hand in creating.

538
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,707
Don't think I don't know that.

539
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:12,009
But we can't let him
endanger our son ever again.

540
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:14,932
If Darius comes back,
I'll take care of it.

541
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,686
If?

542
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,984
I think you mean "when."

543
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:23,490
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
what was going on.

544
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,081
We have enough secrets
in our life with PRIDE.

545
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:29,460
I don't want there to be any between us.

546
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:57,099
Bullshit! It's all bullshit!

547
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:29,540
Hi! Hey, it's just us.

548
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:32,169
Hey. Hi.

549
00:38:33,923 --> 00:38:36,386
Don't worry, she's not gonna hurt you.

550
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,024
Gert?

551
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,070
Yeah?

552
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,166
Why would our parents do
all these horrible things?

553
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,463
I guess...

554
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:59,265
'cause they're horrible people.

555
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:18,428
<i>Manual override activated.</i>

556
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,693
Mom, uh...

557
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:29,075
- I was... I was just...
- It's okay.

558
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,872
You were bound to discover
what it could do...

559
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:35,003
sooner or later.

560
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:40,556
I always thought it was just

561
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,144
an old antique
passed down from your mother.

562
00:39:43,228 --> 00:39:46,777
My mother never gave me anything.

563
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,576
But that's not how I want
things to be with us.

564
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:55,712
You are the only other person in the
world that staff will work for.

565
00:39:57,757 --> 00:39:58,884
Other than me.

566
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:01,972
Here.

567
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:06,650
Why don't you keep it for the night?

568
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:08,529
I trust you, Nico.

569
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:12,286
Entirely.

570
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,710
I hope in time you'll come
to trust me again, too.

571
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:41,302
Dad. Hi, uh...
Sorry, I lost track of time.

572
00:40:41,386 --> 00:40:43,139
Some of the guys got together.

573
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,561
Not to worry. Your mother and
I had to run out as well.

574
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:48,651
But there's something
I want to show you.

575
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:52,408
You inspired me to pull this
back out after all these years,

576
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,080
and time must've given me
some perspective,

577
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:57,794
because I've solved it,

578
00:40:57,877 --> 00:40:59,463
the passion project.

579
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:02,386
A time machine.

580
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,440
That's a time machine?

581
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:12,907
Yeah. And it can't send anyone
anywhere like in the movies.

582
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:14,828
It's more like a radio.

583
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:17,207
It can receive visual messages
from the future,

584
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,420
giving us a glimpse
of what life will be like.

585
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:21,174
How did you do this?

586
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:24,263
It's based on the theory that
if gravity can alter time,

587
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:27,227
- and light can create gravity...
- Then light can also alter time.

588
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:29,983
You're using light to bend
time back in on itself.

589
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:31,737
That's exactly right.

590
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:34,492
Shall we give it a go?

591
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:41,715
Show us Los Angeles of the future.

592
00:41:44,303 --> 00:41:45,973
I'm still...

593
00:41:47,142 --> 00:41:49,146
perfecting some bugs, of course.

594
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:01,713
Damn it!

595
00:42:04,803 --> 00:42:06,264
Are you all right?

596
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:14,781
I was sure the...

597
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,164
the nanotherm therapy was working.

598
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:21,460
It's a... it's an advanced procedure.

599
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:28,308
The research suggests it could be very
effective in cases of glioblastoma.

600
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:31,857
That's a type of...

601
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,484
Brain cancer.

602
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:35,865
Yeah, I know.

603
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:40,206
I haven't told your mother.

604
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:03,419
My son, they used to say that there'd
never be a self-driving car,

605
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:05,090
until I made one.

606
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:10,100
I can beat this thing. I know it.

607
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:16,863
Let's get out of here.

608
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,755
What's going on?

609
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:10,596
You didn't make it.

610
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,856
What are you talking about?

611
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,236
The test isn't over yet.

612
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,283
Our readings show that Ultra
is still out of your reach.

613
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,166
But I felt something.

614
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,878
I'm sorry, Frank.

615
00:44:26,962 --> 00:44:29,508
I know that Leslie
will be disappointed, too.

616
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:48,045
How do you feel?

617
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:52,638
I feel fantastic.

618
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,978
Like I always do.

619
00:44:57,523 --> 00:44:59,401
But that was a close one.

620
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:01,531
I told you we'd find a way.

621
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,785
We had to. The gala's
just a few days away.

622
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,706
The gala! The gala...

623
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:08,002
Who gives a shit about the gala?

624
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:13,220
Let me look at you.

625
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:25,244
You're so...

626
00:45:29,419 --> 00:45:32,050
When I was laying here...

627
00:45:32,133 --> 00:45:35,139
my biggest fear wasn't dying.

628
00:45:35,223 --> 00:45:36,643
It was that I might die

629
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:38,647
without ever having
looked into her eyes.

630
00:45:42,362 --> 00:45:43,532
I want to meet her.

631
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,493
Okay.

632
